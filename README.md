This was our first assignemnt that we had to do in our first year of our Computer Science Bachelor. 

The task was to create a program that would run in the command prompt, which would allow for user input and based on the input, it should produce the appropriate results.
We were not given specific instructions on how to accomplish this, but it was important that the final results of the program would match the ones that were shown to us as an example.

The assignment was the creation of a "fruit market". The fruit that were available in the market were hard coded (Oranges, Apples and Pears). Once the program had launched, input was 
requested from the fruit market "owner", which was the assignment of the prices for the fruit. Afterwards, the fruit market "customer" had to input their current budget, (e.g Â£5. It was specifically requested that GBP were used)
and then they would be presented with the available products in the market. The user then has to input one of the following characters, A, O and P, and each one coresponds to one of the products available. If the customer had enough
money to make a purchase, the transaction would be complete and would be presented with a reciept, which displayed the purchased itme, the price payed and the change of the customer.
If the customer did not posses enough money to make a purchase or inserted a character that was not available, the transaction would be cancelled and the user would be notified that the their purchase was not successful.

Whether the transaction was successful or not, the program would then close, since there was no loop implementation.
Altough it was not asked of us to do so, I decided to put all of the actions in individual void functions in order for the program to be more digestable and easy to read for anyone that is not familiar with the program.
